# Arch Age shaders (alpha)

### Where planar reflections?

I resolved to decline planar reflections due layers 5 and 6. I decided, that more priority has performance, faster POM, nicer screen space reflections. 

### Blend states mod NO more required

It now built-in in Optifine. 

### Split screen ryzen back

Layers is limited up to 4, but you can use it in official Optifine.
